title = 'Refurbishing a Dog Wheelchair in Goa'

I've been refurbishing dog wheelchairs at [ARC South Goa](https://www.arcgoa.in/).

Most doggos needing a wheelchair have experienced some kind of spinal trauma that results in some loss of control over their hind quarters. For some dogs the wheelchair will be something they use to aid recovery and have some fun time while they are recovering. For others, it's a long term arrangement.

This page is intended to help other folk who, like me, want to help at an animal rescue place, but are better at fixing the things around the dogs than fixing the dogs themselves.

Many of the spares are no longer available from the manufacturers, and even if they are available, they are expensive by comparison to the jugaad approach, and not available "today". So using things available in Chaudi (the local town) and some ideas from Liz Gibson, I refurbished 9 dog wheelchairs as my contribution to [ARC South Goa](https://www.arcgoa.in/) during this year's stay in our life away from life.

## Puppy wheelchair

This is much the same as the others, except I used the smaller clear PCV pipe for the main back leg supports.

We hope it won't be needed, but it. has been previously and was in a knackered state before refurbishing.
