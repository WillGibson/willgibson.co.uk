> Jugaad is a concept of non-conventional and frugal innovation on the Indian subcontinent. It includes innovative fixes or simple workarounds, solutions that bend the rules, or resources that can be used in such a way. 

To me, a jugaad is what happens when you make good with the things you find around you. 

I prefer a “strong jugaad”, something that will last a decent length of time, and I’m prepared to visit the local town to find suitable materials for a jugaad. Technically, that might be cheating.
